eps, min_samples, notes
0.7,10,it creates 1-3 clusters. but i think min samples is too high because even though the clusters are decent (when there are 3) there are often 2 objects in the same cluster. there are a lot of batches with 1 cluster and there's a lot of noise. check nlmap_dev_huda/nlmap_hotcake/cache/combined_moving_static_KTH_per_batch_cluster_10_0.7.csv for details
0.7, 6, everything in same cluster
0.8, 6, everything in same cluster
0.7, 5, yeilding pretty decent clusters--up to 6! some are perfect and some are bad. at worst all the pictures are from the same room
0.6, 5, pretty bad. up to 2 clusters but this probably depends on the batch
0.65, 5, really depends on the batch. batches around 365 are pretty good (up to 4 clusters that are decent)
0.9, 5, not great. up to 2-3 clusters that aren't that good
0.5, 4, up to 3 clusters that aren't that bad but some have 0-1 clusters
0.6, 4, very few clusters. mostly just noise
0.7, 4, everything in same cluster

after fixing the bug:

in general the clustering does bad for the room with the cream couch

0.6, 13, bad
0.9,10, not too bad. 1-3 clusters. average of 1.9 clusters per batch (the calculation is: (length of csv - 2 * number of batches) / number of batches). the clusters somewhat make sense
0.8,10, not too bad. 1-3 clusters. average of 1.9 clusters per batch (the calculation is: (length of csv - 2 * number of batches) / number of batches). the clusters somewhat make sense
0.75,10, average 1.6 clusters
0.7,10, pretty bad. 0-2 clusters
0.65,10, also bad. 0-2 or 3 clusters
0.6,10, also bad
0.5,10, terrible
0.7, 7, average of 2.4 clusters per batch (ran for 333 batches). some make sense and some are random. sometimes the same room is split into two clusters
0.7, 6, average of 3.1 clusters per batch
0.7, 5, average of 3.77 clusters per batch. 
0.8, 3, clusters aren't too accurate. lower epsilon is better
0.7, 3, average of 7.6 clusters per batch. pretty good! picking up on objects that were previously considered noise. the worst cluster is the one that has a lot of crops but the rest aren't that bad
0.6, 3, average of 8 clusters per batch. i'm impressed! very good results. a bit better than 0.7 i think. with improved embeddings this could be really good. some objects are split into 2 clusters but there are more objects that are correctly clustered
0.5, 3, average of 8 clusters per batch. i'm impressed! very good results. a bit better than 0.7 i think. with improved embeddings this could be really good. some objects are split into 2 clusters but there are more objects that are correctly clustered
